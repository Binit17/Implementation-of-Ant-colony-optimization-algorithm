# Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) Algorithm

## Overview
This project implements the **Ant Colony Optimization (ACO)** algorithm, inspired by the behavior of ants searching for food, to solve optimization problems. The algorithm models a population of artificial ants that traverse a graph and iteratively find optimal or near-optimal solutions based on pheromone trails and heuristic information.

---

## Key Features
- **Graph Representation**: The problem is represented as a graph where ants traverse to find optimal paths.  
- **Pheromone Updates**: Ants deposit pheromones on paths based on the quality of the solution, guiding future ants.  
- **Heuristic Guidance**: Ants prioritize paths using problem-specific heuristic information.  
- **Evaporation Mechanism**: Pheromone levels decay over time to prevent convergence to suboptimal solutions.

## Applications
- **Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)**  
- **Vehicle Routing Problems**  
- **Network Routing**  
- **Task Scheduling**

## Implementation
1. **Initialization**: Define parameters (e.g., number of ants, pheromone evaporation rate, alpha, beta).  
2. **Ant Movement**: Ants probabilistically select paths based on pheromone intensity and heuristic values.  
3. **Pheromone Update**: After each iteration, pheromones are reinforced along the best paths and evaporated elsewhere.  
4. **Solution Optimization**: Repeat the process for several iterations or until convergence.

## Learnings
Implementing ACO provided insights into metaheuristic optimization techniques, probabilistic decision-making, and balancing exploration vs. exploitation in algorithms.
